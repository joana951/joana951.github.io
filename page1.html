        <div class="lead"><p>Rizal Park or Luneta Park was built as a tribute to our greatest national hero – Dr. Jose Rizal. It is one of the leading historical sites in the Philippines where Rizal was executed by the Spanish military firing squad on December 30, 1896. Nowadays, it is one of the major tourist attractions of Manila. The park became a favorite spot for unwinding and socializing. It is also a place for family bonding and picnics during Sundays and holidays.</p><p><br></p></div>

        <div class="lead"><p>Known to be the “the Rock”, Corregidor is known for its important historical attractions. When the Japanese invaded the Philippines, Corregidor became the headquarters of the Allied Forces and also the seat of Philippine Commonwealth government. The huge firearms of Corregidor which are used in support for Filipino and American defenders of Bataan are now silent but the damage seen on buildings, structures, and tunnels in the island continues on telling a very moving story of a war that has claimed so many lives. A visit to this former battleground is a memorable experience, especially for those people who value and cherish freedom and peace.</p></div>

        <div class="lead"><p>If you ever drop by Tacloban City, the Leyte Landing Memorial Park, formerly known as the “McArthur Park,” is a must-visit destination. Remember the promise made by Gen. Douglas McArthur “I shall return”? He kept this promise when he returned with an army of 700 ships containing 174,000 American soldiers at Red Beach, Palo, Leyte on October 20, 1944. The “red” in Red Beach doesn’t refer to the natural color of the sand, but its color after being drenched in blood.</p><p><span style="font-size: 1.07rem; line-height: 1.5;">Many tourists visit the park to reminisce an important event in history – the fulfilment of Gen. McArthur’s promise to the Filipinos to come back and help them win against the Japanese colonies. It always brings inspirational memories of how our beloved ancestors fought for our freedom.</span><br></p></div>
